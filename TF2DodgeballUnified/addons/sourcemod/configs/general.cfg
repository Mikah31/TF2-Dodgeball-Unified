// There is not a tick modifier modifying turnrate or speed, if you change the tickrate you need to redo your rocket configs!
//
// Write formula's explicitly -> 50x (BAD) ; 50*x (GOOD)
// Do NOT use: spaces & -- or +- in formula's (signs infront of numbers are allowed)
// x is the number of deflections of the rocket
// Allowed operations: +, -, *, /, ^, ()
// So a rocket which damage start at 50 & increases by 75 per deflect would be: "75*x+50"
//
// Special variables:
// x -> deflection count
// s -> rocket speed
// a -> 0.0 until deflection threshold is reached, then 1.0
// b -> 0.0 until deflection threshold is reached, then 1.0
//
// Regarding formula's for rocketspeed, we have unlocked the maximum velocity so we need to cap it (otherwise it will go too fast)
// 
// For rocket speed we (can) use a sigmoid function:
// https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nr7nshysra
//
// Copy/write the results (in the output section) in this template (sigmoid function):
// d+(a-d)/(1+(x/c)^b)
//
// You can also use https://mycurvefit.com/, to fit any function (Can be used for turnrate as rocket speed)
//
// The conversion from MpH -> Speed = 23.4664664195
// So multiply formula by 23.466*(...) if your input is in MpH
